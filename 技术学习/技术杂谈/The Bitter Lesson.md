The biggest lesson that can be read from 70 years of AI research is that general methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective, and by a large margin. The ultimate reason for this is Moore's law, or rather its generalization of continued exponentially falling cost per unit of computation. Most AI research has been conducted as if the computation available to the agent were constant (in which case leveraging human knowledge would be one of the only ways to improve performance) but, over a slightly longer time than a typical research project, massively more computation inevitably becomes available. Seeking an improvement that makes a difference in the shorter term, researchers seek to leverage their human knowledge of the domain, but the only thing that matters in the long run is the leveraging of computation. These two need not run counter to each other, but in practice they tend to. Time spent on one is time not spent on the other. There are psychological commitments to investment in one approach or the other. And the human-knowledge approach tends to complicate methods in ways that make them less suited to taking advantage of general methods leveraging computation. There were many examples of AI researchers' belated learning of this bitter lesson, and it is instructive to review some of the most prominent.

从 70 年的人工智能研究中可以学到的最大教训是，利用计算的通用方法最终是最有效的，而且效率很高。这其中的根本原因是摩尔定律，或者更准确地说是计算单位成本持续呈指数下降的一般性趋势。大多数人工智能研究都是在假设给定的计算资源是恒定的（在这种情况下，利用人类知识将是提高性能的主要途径），但是，在稍长于典型研究项目的时间内，必然会有大量更多的计算资源可用。为了寻求在短期内取得改进，研究人员试图利用他们对领域的人类知识，但从长远来看，唯一重要的是利用计算资源。这两者并不一定相互抵触，但在实践中往往会如此。花在一个方法上的时间就是没有花在另一个方法上的时间。人们对投资于其中一种方法的心理承诺也会影响到这一点。人类知识方法往往会使问题变得复杂，使其不太适合利用利用计算的通用方法。有许多例子表明人工智能研究人员在后来才学到了这个痛苦的教训，回顾其中一些最显著的例子是很有启发性的。

In computer chess, the methods that defeated the world champion, Kasparov, in 1997, were based on massive, deep search. At the time, this was looked upon with dismay by the majority of computer-chess researchers who had pursued methods that leveraged human understanding of the special structure of chess. When a simpler, search-based approach with special hardware and software proved vastly more effective, these human-knowledge-based chess researchers were not good losers. They said that "brute force" search may have won this time, but it was not a general strategy, and anyway it was not how people played chess. These researchers wanted methods based on human input to win and were disappointed when they did not.

在计算机国际象棋领域，1997 年击败世界冠军卡斯帕罗夫的方法是基于大规模、深度搜索的。当时，这种方法让大多数追求利用人类对象棋特殊结构的理解的计算机国际象棋研究者感到沮丧。当一个更简单、基于搜索的方法结合特殊的硬件和软件被证明比其他方法更加有效时，这些基于人类知识的国际象棋研究者并不是好的失败者。他们说，“蛮力”搜索也许这次赢了，但这并不是一种通用策略，而且这也不是人们下棋的方式。这些研究者希望基于人类输入的方法获胜，并且当他们没有获胜时感到失望。

A similar pattern of research progress was seen in computer Go, only delayed by a further 20 years. Enormous initial efforts went into avoiding search by taking advantage of human knowledge, or of the special features of the game, but all those efforts proved irrelevant, or worse, once search was applied effectively at scale. Also important was the use of learning by self play to learn a value function (as it was in many other games and even in chess, although learning did not play a big role in the 1997 program that first beat a world champion). Learning by self play, and learning in general, is like search in that it enables massive computation to be brought to bear. Search and learning are the two most important classes of techniques for utilizing massive amounts of computation in AI research. In computer Go, as in computer chess, researchers' initial effort was directed towards utilizing human understanding (so that less search was needed) and only much later was much greater success had by embracing search and learning.

类似的研究进展模式也出现在计算机围棋领域，只是延迟了 20 年。最初的巨大努力是通过利用人类知识或围棋的特点来避免搜索，但所有这些努力在大规模有效地应用搜索后都被证明是无关紧要的，甚至更糟。同样重要的是利用自我对弈学习价值函数（就像在许多其他游戏中甚至在国际象棋中一样，尽管学习在首次击败世界冠军的 1997 年程序中并没有起到很大的作用）。通过自我对弈学习和一般学习，就像搜索一样，可以实现大规模计算的运用。搜索和学习是利用大量计算的 AI 研究中最重要的两类技术。在计算机围棋中，与计算机国际象棋一样，研究人员最初的努力是为了利用人类理解（以便需要较少的搜索），而只有在后来才通过采用搜索和学习取得了更大的成功。

In speech recognition, there was an early competition, sponsored by DARPA, in the 1970s. Entrants included a host of special methods that took advantage of human knowledge---knowledge of words, of phonemes, of the human vocal tract, etc. On the other side were newer methods that were more statistical in nature and did much more computation, based on hidden Markov models (HMMs). Again, the statistical methods won out over the human-knowledge-based methods. This led to a major change in all of natural language processing, gradually over decades, where statistics and computation came to dominate the field. The recent rise of deep learning in speech recognition is the most recent step in this consistent direction. Deep learning methods rely even less on human knowledge, and use even more computation, together with learning on huge training sets, to produce dramatically better speech recognition systems. As in the games, researchers always tried to make systems that worked the way the researchers thought their own minds worked---they tried to put that knowledge in their systems---but it proved ultimately counterproductive, and a colossal waste of researcher's time, when, through Moore's law, massive computation became available and a means was found to put it to good use.

在语音识别领域，上世纪 70 年代有一个由 DARPA 赞助的早期竞赛。参赛者包括一系列利用人类知识的特殊方法——词汇知识、音素知识、人类声道等等。另一方面是基于隐马尔可夫模型（HMMs）的新方法，它们本质上更具统计性，并且进行了更多计算。同样，统计方法战胜了基于人类知识的方法。这导致了几十年来自然语言处理领域的重大变革，统计和计算逐渐成为主导。深度学习在语音识别中的最新兴起是这一一致趋势的最新一步。深度学习方法甚至更少依赖于人类知识，而利用更多的计算资源，并结合在庞大的训练集上进行学习，从而产生了显著更好的语音识别系统。与国际象棋和围棋一样，研究人员总是试图制作符合研究人员自己认为的大脑运行方式的系统——他们试图将这些知识放入他们的系统中——但最终证明这是适得其反的，浪费了大量研究人员的时间。因为通过摩尔定律，大规模计算资源变得可用，并且找到了一种可以充分利用它的方法。

In computer vision, there has been a similar pattern. Early methods conceived of vision as searching for edges, or generalized cylinders, or in terms of SIFT features. But today all this is discarded. Modern deep-learning neural networks use only the notions of convolution and certain kinds of invariances, and perform much better.

在计算机视觉领域，也存在类似的模式。 早期的方法将视觉视为搜索边缘、广义圆柱体或 SIFT 特征。 但今天这一切都被抛弃了。 现代深度学习神经网络仅使用卷积和某些不变性的概念，并且性能更好。

This is a big lesson. As a field, we still have not thoroughly learned it, as we are continuing to make the same kind of mistakes. To see this, and to effectively resist it, we have to understand the appeal of these mistakes. We have to learn the bitter lesson that building in how we think we think does not work in the long run. The bitter lesson is based on the historical observations that 1) AI researchers have often tried to build knowledge into their agents, 2) this always helps in the short term, and is personally satisfying to the researcher, but 3) in the long run it plateaus and even inhibits further progress, and 4) breakthrough progress eventually arrives by an opposing approach based on scaling computation by search and learning. The eventual success is tinged with bitterness, and often incompletely digested, because it is success over a favored, human-centric approach.

这是一个重要的教训。作为一个领域，我们仍然没有彻底地学到这个教训，因为我们仍在继续犯同样类型的错误。要看到这一点，并有效地抵制它，我们必须理解这些错误的吸引力。我们必须学会痛苦的教训，即在长远来看，按照我们认为的思维方式构建并不奏效。这个痛苦的教训基于以下历史观察：1）人工智能研究人员经常试图将知识建立到他们的 agent 中；2）这在短期内总是有帮助的，并且对研究人员个人而言是令人满意的，但是；3）长期来看，它会趋于停滞甚至抑制进一步的进展；4）最终的突破性进展最终是通过与之相反的方法，即通过搜索和学习来扩展计算量。最终的成功带有一丝苦涩，通常难以完全消化，因为它是相对于一个受青睐的、以人为中心的方法的成功。

One thing that should be learned from the bitter lesson is the great power of general purpose methods, of methods that continue to scale with increased computation even as the available computation becomes very great. The two methods that seem to scale arbitrarily in this way are search and learning.

应该从惨痛的教训中学到的一件事是通用方法的强大力量，即使可用计算变得非常大，这些方法也可以随着计算的增加而继续扩展。 以这种方式任意扩展的两种方法似乎是搜索和学习。

The second general point to be learned from the bitter lesson is that the actual contents of minds are tremendously, irredeemably complex; we should stop trying to find simple ways to think about the contents of minds, such as simple ways to think about space, objects, multiple agents, or symmetries. All these are part of the arbitrary, intrinsically-complex, outside world. They are not what should be built in, as their complexity is endless; instead we should build in only the meta-methods that can find and capture this arbitrary complexity. Essential to these methods is that they can find good approximations, but the search for them should be by our methods, not by us. We want AI agents that can discover like we can, not which contain what we have discovered. Building in our discoveries only makes it harder to see how the discovering process can be done.

从这个痛苦的教训中要学到的第二个普遍观点是，思想的实际内容是极其、无可救药的复杂；我们应该停止试图寻找简单的思考方式来思考思想的内容，比如思考空间、物体、多重主体或对称性的简单方法。所有这些都是任意的、固有复杂的外部世界的一部分。它们不应该被构建进去，因为它们的复杂性是无穷无尽的；相反，我们应该只构建可以找到并捕捉这种任意复杂性的元方法。这些方法的本质是它们能够找到良好的近似值，但是寻找它们的过程应该由我们的方法来完成，而不是由我们自己来完成。我们希望 AI agent 能够像我们一样发现，而不是包含我们已经发现的内容。将我们的发现纳入其中只会让我们更难以看到发现过程是如何完成的。
